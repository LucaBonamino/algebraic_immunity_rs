# algebraic_immunity_rs
A rust library to compute the algebraic immunity of Boolean functions.

## Installation
Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
algebraic_immunity = "0.1.0"
```

## Usage
```Rust
use algebraic_immunity::ai::AlgebraicImmunity;

let ve = vec![0,1,0,0];
let immunity = AlgebraicImmunity::algebraic_immunity(ve, 2;
assert_eq!(immunity, 5);
```
```Rust
use algebraic_immunity::ai::AlgebraicImmunity;

let ve = vec![
