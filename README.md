# algebraic_immunity_rs
A Rust library to compute the algebraic immunity and restructes algebraic immunity of Boolean functions.

<b>Reference:</b></br>
*"Computing the Restricted Algebraic Immunity, and Application to WPB Functions"*  
Luca Bonamino and Pierrick Méaux. [IACR ePrint 2025/1779](https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1779).

## Installation
Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
algebraic_immunity = "0.3.0"
```

## Usage
From `BooleanFunction` struct.
``` Rust
use alebraic_immunity::boolean_functions::BooleanFunction;
let ve = vec![0,1,0,0];
let bf = BooleanFuntion::from_truth_table(ve.clone());

let immunity = bf.algebraic_immunity();
assert_eq!(immunity, 1);

let restricted_immunity = bf.restricted_algebraic_immunity(vec![0,1,2]);
assert_eq!(restricted_immunity, 1);


```

Directly from `AlgebraicImmunity` and `RestrictedAlgebraicImmunity` structs.
```Rust
use algebraic_immunity::ai::{AlgebraicImmunity, RestrictedAlgebraicImmunity};

let ve = vec![0,1,0,0];
let immunity = AlgebraicImmunity::algebraic_immunity(ve, 2);
assert_eq!(immunity, 1);

let restricted_immunity = RestrictedAlgebraicImmunity::algebraic_immunity(ve, vec![0,1,2], 2);
assert_eq!(restricted_immunity, 1);
```
```Rust
use algebraic_immunity::ai::{AlgebraicImmunity, RestrictedAlgebraicImmunity};

let ve = vec![
